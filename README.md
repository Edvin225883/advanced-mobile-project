In the era of technology, the demand for computer parts is consistently growing. To cater to this demand and provide users with a seamless shopping experience, we propose to develop a mobile application using React Native for a computer parts store. This application will offer a convenient platform for users to browse, purchase, and manage computer parts from their mobile devices.

The primary objectives of the proposed mobile application are:

To provide a user-friendly interface for browsing a wide range of computer parts.
To enable users to create accounts and securely log in to manage their profiles and order history.
To incorporate functionalities such as product search, filtering, and sorting for enhanced user experience.
To ensure compatibility across various mobile devices and operating systems.

In conclusion, the proposed mobile application aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient platform for purchasing computer parts. With its user-friendly interface, robust features, and seamless performance, the application will cater to the growing demand for technology products while ensuring a delightful shopping experience for users.
